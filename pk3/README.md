# UIX

UI Extensions for MM8BDM v6b
by Russel

Addon that implements additional UI elements:
- Enhanced TeamInfo.
- Weapon inventory bar.
- SR50 tailwind.
- Enhanced pickup respawn indicators.

Modder notes:
- Currently only works with v6b.
- Due to the way weapons are implemented in v6b, this mod manually has to support mods to work with the weapon bar.
- The following mods are implemented:
  - Armory of Evil (by Ecl1p5e)
  - Mega Man DOS Reborn weapons (by Trill, et al.)
  - Mega Man Rock Force weapons (by Trill, et al.)
  - Megaman Unlimited Weapons (by JaxOf7)
  - Rockman No Constancy weapons (by Trill, et al.)
  - Touhou Koumakyou Weps (2023) (by Xelt)
  - Ukiweps (by Ukiyama)
  - Allanxweps (by Allanxindustries)
  - Item Asylum (by JumboDS64)

I typically hang out in the MM8BDM unofficial discord (linked from the forums), TSPG discord, or in the Gondola discord.
My name is Russel, or RusselCS. Please describe me with he/him or they/them pronouns.
